This project focus on what is an Convolutional Neural Network or also known as CNN.

The cnn_tf_analysis.ipynb file used for checking and comparing different CNN architectures and how they affect the result.

The cnn_analysis.ipynb file used for checking what inside CNN layers.

You will need to install tensorflow, pandas and matplotlib for running the code.

If you want to setup tensorflow that can detect gpu on native window, here is the link for the anaconda environment setup: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
